Springboot Features:
=====================
    D. Spring Boot Actuator:
    =========================
        Feature:
        =========
            -- Actuator is a set of built-in endpoints that provide a range of production-ready features like monitoring, metrics, health checks, and more.
            -- Example endpoints include /actuator/health for health status, /actuator/metrics for application metrics, and /actuator/beans for a list of Spring beans in the application context.

        Advantages:
        ============
            a. Operational Insight: Provides detailed insights into the state and performance of your application.
            b. Customizable: You can add custom health checks, metrics, and endpoints specific to your application.
            c. Security: Actuator endpoints can be secured and exposed only to authorized users, making it safe to use in production environments.
            
    E. Spring Boot DevTools:
    =========================
        -- Spring Boot DevTools is a module in Spring Boot that enhances the development experience by providing a set of tools that can speed up the coding, testing, and debugging process. 
        -- It includes features like automatic restarts, live reload, and configurations optimized for development, making the development cycle faster and more efficient.
        
        Feature:
        =========
            Spring Boot DevTools is a development-time tool that provides features like automatic restarts, live reload, and configurations optimized for development.

        Advantages:
        ============
            a. Increased Productivity: Automatic restarts on code changes and live reload of static resources help in reducing the time spent on rebuilding and redeploying the application during development.
            b. Convenience: Provides useful defaults and features for developers, such as disabling cache in templates.
            
        Key Features of Spring Boot DevTools:
        ======================================
            a. Automatic Restart:
            ======================
                1. One of the most significant features of Spring Boot DevTools is automatic restart. This feature automatically restarts your Spring Boot application whenever a classpath change is detected.
                2. This is particularly useful because it eliminates the need to manually stop and restart your application every time you make a change, allowing for much faster iteration during development.
                3. DevTools achieves this by separating your application's classes into two classloaders: one for classes that don’t change (like dependencies) and one for classes that do 
                   (like your application code). Only the classloader for the changing classes is reloaded, making the restart faster.
                Ex: 
                ====
                    When you modify a controller class and save the file, DevTools will automatically restart the application, and you can see the changes reflected almost immediately.
                    
            b. LiveReload Integration:
            ===========================
                -- How It Works: After you start your application with DevTools, you can install a LiveReload browser extension. When DevTools detects changes, it communicates with the LiveReload 
                   server, which in turn triggers a browser refresh.
                   
        Dependency:
        ============
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
                <optional>true</optional>
            </dependency>
                   
    F. Externalized Configuration: Link(https://medium.com/javajams/spring-boot-and-the-magic-of-externalized-configuration-a-practical-guide-32cdb179c7b3)
    ===============================
        -- Externalized Configuration in Spring Boot refers to the practice of separating configuration settings from the application code, allowing these settings to be modified without changing the 
           code or rebuilding the application. 
        -- This approach is essential for managing different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) where configurations may vary. Externalized configuration enhances flexibility, 
           maintainability, and security by allowing environment-specific settings to be managed independently of the application itself.
           
        Key Concepts of Externalized Configuration:
        ============================================
            1. Configuration Sources:
            ==========================
                -- Spring Boot allows configuration properties to be sourced from various places, providing a flexible way to manage application settings. These sources are considered in a specific 
                   order, with the last source overriding earlier ones.
                   
                Feature:
                =========
                    -- Spring Boot allows you to externalize your configuration, making it easy to maintain different environments (development, staging, production) without changing your application code.
                    -- Configuration can be provided via properties files, YAML files, environment variables, command-line arguments, or directly in the application.
                    
                Advantages:
                ============
                    -- Environment-Specific Configuration: Easily manage configuration for different environments.
                    -- Flexibility: Supports multiple formats and locations for configuration, making it adaptable to various deployment scenarios.

                Common Configuration Sources:
                ==============================
                    Default properties (specified using @Value or @ConfigurationProperties).
                    a. application.properties or application.yml files: Located in the src/main/resources directory or in an external location.
                    b. Environment variables: Operating system-level variables that can be accessed by the application.
                    c. Command-line arguments: Passed when starting the application.
                    d. Java System properties: Set using the -D option when running the JVM.
                    e. Application arguments: Passed directly to SpringApplication.run().
                    
                Hierarchy of Sources: 
                ======================
                    Spring Boot considers the configuration sources in a specific order, with later sources overriding earlier ones. 
                    The hierarchy is:
                        a. Command-line arguments.
                        b. Java System properties (-D parameters).
                        c. Environment variables.
                        d. application.properties or application.yml.
                        f. Default properties defined in the application.
                    Ex: 
                    ====
                        -- If you set a property like server.port in multiple sources, the value from the command-line argument will take precedence, followed by environment variables, then the 
                           application.properties file, and finally, any default value in the code.
                           
            2. application.properties and application.yml Files:
            =====================================================
                -- These files are the most common way to externalize configuration in Spring Boot. They can be used to define key-value pairs that configure various aspects of the application.
                Example (application.properties):
                ==================================
                    server.port=8080
                    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
                    spring.datasource.username=root
                    spring.datasource.password=secret
                    
            3. Profile-Specific Properties:
            ================================
                -- Spring Boot allows you to define environment-specific configurations using profiles. You can create different property files for different profiles, such as 
                   application-dev.properties, application-prod.yml, etc.
                -- Activating Profiles: Profiles can be activated by setting the spring.profiles.active property. For example, to activate the prod profile, you can start the application with:
                   --> java -jar myapp.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
                Ex:
                ====
                    a. application-dev.properties:
                    ===============================
                        server.port=8081
                        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/devdb
                        
                    b. application-prod.properties:
                    ================================
                        server.port=80
                        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://prod-db-server:3306/proddb
                        spring.datasource.username=produser
                        spring.datasource.password=prodsecret
                        
            4. Environment Variables:
            ==========================
                -- Environment variables provide a way to externalize configuration without changing the application’s configuration files. This is particularly useful in cloud or containerized 
                   environments like Docker or Kubernetes, where environment variables are a standard way to manage configuration.
                -- The application automatically picks up these environment variables and uses them as configuration values.
                Ex:
                ====
                    export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
                    export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root
                    export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=secret
                    
            5. Command-Line Arguments:
            ===========================
                -- You can pass configuration properties directly when starting your Spring Boot application. This is particularly useful for overriding properties in specific situations, like 
                   in CI/CD pipelines or scripts.
                Ex:
                ====
                --> java -jar myapp.jar --server.port=9090 --spring.profiles.active=prod
                    
            6. Java System Properties:
            ===========================
                Java system properties are another way to externalize configuration. These properties are set using the -D option when starting the JVM.
                Ex:
                ====
                --> java -Dserver.port=9090 -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -jar myapp.jar
                
            7. Type-Safe Configuration with @ConfigurationProperties:
            ==========================================================
                -- The @ConfigurationProperties annotation allows you to bind external properties to a type-safe Java object, making it easier to work with complex configurations.
                Ex:
                ====
                    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
                    public class AppConfig {
                        private String name;
                        private int maxUsers;

                        // Getters and setters
                    }
                    
                application.properties:
                ========================
                    app.name=MyApplication
                    app.maxUsers=100
                    
        G. Spring Initializr:
        ======================
            Feature:
            =========
                -- Spring Initializr is a web-based tool that allows developers to generate Spring Boot project structures with their choice of dependencies.
                -- Available at start.spring.io, it provides a simple UI for selecting dependencies, project metadata, and packaging type.

            Advantages:
            ============
                a. Quick Project Setup: Generates a project structure and dependencies in seconds, allowing developers to start coding right away.
                b. Customization: Provides options for language (Java, Kotlin, Groovy), build tool (Maven, Gradle), and more.
                
        H. Production-Ready Features:
        ==============================
            Feature:
            =========
                -- Spring Boot is designed to be production-ready from the start. It includes features like logging, security, and monitoring that are crucial in production environments.
                -- Default configurations are provided for most production requirements, but they can be easily overridden.

            Advantages:
            ============
                a. Out-of-the-Box Readiness: Applications can move to production with minimal configuration.
                b. Security: Integrated support for Spring Security simplifies securing applications with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
                
        I. Microservices Support:
        ==========================
            Feature:
            =========
                -- Spring Boot is well-suited for building microservices due to its lightweight nature, ease of deployment, and ability to integrate with cloud-native tools and frameworks like Spring Cloud.

            Advantages:
            ============
                a. Scalability: Spring Boot applications can be easily scaled horizontally, making them ideal for microservices architectures.
                b. Integration with Spring Cloud: Provides seamless integration with Spring Cloud components like Config Server, Eureka, Hystrix, and others, making it easier to build resilient, 
                   distributed systems.
